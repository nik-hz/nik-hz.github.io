I’m **Nikolaus Holzer**, a researcher at **Columbia University** working at the intersection of **formal methods**, **reinforcement learning**, and **causal reasoning**.  
My work focuses on making intelligent systems interpretable — bridging symbolic logic and learning to understand *why* agents make decisions.
