I am a researcher at **Columbia University**  advised by Professor [Baishakhi Ray](https://www.rayb.info) and Professor [Mark Santolucito](https://www.marksantolucito.com/index.html) working at the intersection of **code generation**, **reinforcement learning**, **formal methods**, and **causal reasoning**.

My work focuses on designing better code generation systems. Our field is focusing more and more on agentic reasoning and with that comes a greater focus on reasoning as a whole. I am interestednmaking intelligent systems more intelligent and learning to understand *why* agents make decisions.
